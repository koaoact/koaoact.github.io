## András Kovács - Cosmologist

I view myself primarily as a _data-oriented_ astrophysicist who focuses on the characterisation of the cosmic [large-scale structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Large-scale_structure) (LSS). I specialised in novel observational probes of the mysterious [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy), that is among the biggest puzzles in fundamental physics today. 

I devoted my career to understand this mystery. You can find more details about my research on the web page of the [Cosmo-LSS](http://research.iac.es/proyecto/cosmolss/pages/en/about-contact.php) research group at the [Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias](https://www.iac.es/) (IAC) where I currently hold a Juan de la Cierva _Incorporación_ postdoctoral fellowship.

### News: _Scientists move a step closer to understanding the “cold spot” in the cosmic microwave background_

### Researcher Profile

The standard ΛCDM (Lambda-Cold Dark Matter) cosmological model has emerged as the consensus model of Einstein's generally relativistic universe. It has shown truly remarkable explanatory power over a variety of cosmic scales and epochs, and it narrates a reassuring story of a model universe currently filled mostly with dark matter and dark energy. However, this explanation is not _completely_ satisfactory because the actual nature of the dark sector remains a key puzzle.

To address this problem, international collaborations have built new instruments to map ever larger cosmological volumes. I have led data-analysis projects (with about 100 participants) in state-of-the-art galaxy and quasar surveys (DES, Euclid, eBOSS), with a pioneering role in precise measurements and simulations of the [integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachs%E2%80%93Wolfe_effect) (ISW) effect. 

In particular, I established myself as a leading international expert in mapping the largest under-dense structures in the cosmic web, the _cosmic voids_, that I have used for CMB-LSS cross-correlation studies. My ground-breaking results in observational cosmology have generated considerable media attention including a cover of the [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-emptiest-place-in-space/) and a [Fermilab](https://news.fnal.gov/2022/01/scientists-move-a-step-closer-to-understanding-the-cold-spot-in-the-cosmic-microwave-background/) press release.

### CV summary

My career can be summarised as a series of fruitful transfers of knowledge in data-analysis to ever more complicated cosmological data sets. I obtained my PhD degree from the [Eötvös University](https://physics.elte.hu/) (2011-2014), supported by significant training at the [University of Hawaii](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/) (USA). Then, I had postdoc positions at the [Institut de Física d’Altes Energíes](https://www.ifae.es/) (IFAE, 2014-18), and at the [Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias](https://www.iac.es/) (IAC, 2018-22). Working with two PhD students and a MSc student, I now hold a Juan de la Cierva _Incorporación_ fellowship (success rate <7,5%).

Since 2016, I have been co-convener of the DES "Voids and Troughs" analysis team (~15-20 international researchers). I am also founding member of the “EuclidVoids” research team (~90 scientists). My extensive experience with data analysis and my leadership in international collaborations now put me in a strong position to lead the planned ISW and lensing analyses for the next big cosmological experiments (DESI, Euclid, LSST, J-PAS, WEAVE-QSO) that will provide unprecedented new data in the next 5-6 years with vital Spanish contributions.
